## **Objective**

- To analyze sales data and answer the following:
  - Which products and categories generate the highest sales?
  - Which regions contribute most to revenue?
  - What are the monthly/seasonal trends?
  - How does profit compare with sales?

---

## **Dataset**

- **Source:** Superstore sample dataset (provided for the internship)
- **Fields:** Order Date, Sales, Profit, Category, Sub-Category, Region, Product Name, Quantity, etc.

## **Tools & Skills Used**

- **Power BI**
  - Data cleaning and modeling
  - Bar, Line, Scatter, Map, and KPI visualizations

## **Dashboard Features**

## **Key Findings**

- **Technology** is the top-performing category due to high demand for electronics and office-related products.
- **Office Supplies** show consistent sales but low profit margins, likely due to frequent discounts.
- **Furniture** contributes moderate sales but suffers from high shipping and operational costs, affecting profitability.
- **Western and Southern regions** dominate sales, probably due to larger customer bases and corporate demand.
- **Seasonal trends** indicate peaks during year-end months, driven by holiday shopping and corporate spending.
- **High sales ≠ high profit**: Several high-revenue products deliver low margins due to discounts and high delivery costs.
